Description: async fingerprint library of fprint project, development headers
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.
 .
 libfprint is the centre of efforts, it is the component which does the dirty
 work of talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint
 data.
 .
 This library is based on new aproach of libusb-1.0, which handles asynchronous 
 callback model allowing to perform a non-blocking device task. Old synchronous 
 library has been renamed to libfprint-old.
 .
 This package provides development headers.
